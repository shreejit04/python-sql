There are a total of 3 interactable files: main.py, loadData.py, and DELETE.py:
main.py will start the flask website.
	- This should be the only file that needs to be ran

DELETE.py will DELETE ALL rows from the User table inside the Project1.db file
	*THIS FILE is NOT needed as I have also provided Project1.db in the zip
	*This is only for T.A testing if needed

loadData.py will load the data from "credentials1.txt" and "credentials2.txt" into Project1.db
	*THIS FILE is NOT needed as I have already provided Project1.db in the zip
	*This is only for T.A testing if needed




IF Project1.db is corrupted/unusable, delete Project1.db from current directory 
and run loadData.py(make sure "credentials1.txt" and "credentials2.txt" is in the same directory)
